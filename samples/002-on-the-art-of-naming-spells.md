# On The Art of Naming Spells

Naming spells is extremely hard. You have to be intentional, you have to be descriptive, but most importantly, you have to be true to yourself, your voice, your essence as a Wizard. Your spells are a representation of yourself.

Through the ages I have developed a system that has treated me well and contributed in a high measure to receiving the illustrious Bonel Prize of Spellcrafting in no less than 7 ocassions.

The system goes as follows. You pick a word:

Fireball

And you append and prepend two particles:

Igneous Fireball of Incandescence

Boom! Brilliant! Can you create some awesome spells with the following words?

Imp
Agility
Sleep
Portal
Chorizo
Healing
